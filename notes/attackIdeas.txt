Passive Abilities

//it is feeling more and more that these abilities should be unlocked early on
Double Jump - Double jump you idiot  I still donâ€™t get it.
Charge Blast - Hold attack down to begin charge. Can release full or half charge attack.
Soul Steal - Finishing melee attack that will regain HP (and possibly other resources).  Auto executed if you are in melee range of an enemy and the hit is a killing blow.
Forward Dash - Same thing as the back dash but...forwards. Uses Q/E


Active Abilities - triangle
	
Shadow Form - Enter shadow form and move around in stealth, exit with a powerful attack.
Magma Mucus - Create a ball of magma that the player can control.  Burns plant and ice obstacles.
Terra Block - Shoot out a chunk of rock that turns into 2x2 tile block.  Using this skill again while the block is in air will cause it to land, doing
damage and knocking	back enemies beneath it. The block remains on the ground and can be used to reach new areas until the skill is used again.
Bubble - Places a bubble around the player that absorbs one (projectile only?) attack.  While active, the bubble alows the player to walk/run on water.
Tornado Legs - Do I even need to explain?  No.


Elemental Attack (sub weapon) - circle
	
Dark: The Vile Vial - Toss a vial that explodes on impact.
	-hesitant to make this a special ability because the explosion is an easy way to add exploration
Fire: Fire Columns - Shoot forward pillars of fire that burn through multiple enemies, leave DoT burn.
	-hesitant to make this a special attack considering theres no vertical element
	-instead, thinking you could hold down circle and fire continually flies out 
Earth: Vine Whip - 5 vines whip out in a fan shape in front of the player.
	-this idea will be legit if it was a 2 phase attack, vines go out, and the end of the vines
		pop out some other attack, flowers blooming or w/e
Water:	Jet Torpedo - homing projectile
	-this is a good idea except instead of a torpedo, it should be a shark, something not technological
Wind: Shuriken - Boomerang like ellipse motion.
Light: Toggle on/off burst of light aoe from the player every .5 seconds
